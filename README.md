# Sinai Data Science
Powerpoints and iPython notebooks written by me for the Sinai Data Science club.
iPython notebooks are hosted and run on my personal webserver, rahmannoodles.org, and reuploaded here. 
The iPython notebook server opens 1 hour before we meet and is closed the following day for security reasons.
